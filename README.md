# Portfolio
This repository consists of projects I have done during my time at the University or during my free time.

## Battleships
This a project a did during my first semester at University. The task was to do a project in C and apply everything we learned so far. This could have been anything. I decided to implement Battleships by using SDL2.
The code is not good, and is definitly not an example on how I code today. This project is supposed to show one of my passions. In order to run the project, which I do not recommend, you need to install SDL2.

## Bachelor's Thesis
This folder consists of two projects regarding my bachelor's thesis. One part is a simulation software implemented in Java and the ther part are evaluation scripts written in python. 
For my bachelor's thesis I was supposed to simulate a specifc type of consensus process. The consensus is based on the distances between the nodes present in the process.
The process itself is simulated in rounds. In each round a node can ask two other nodes where they are located in space and make a decisions based on that to which node the asking node should go.
The goal of this simulation was to find out how many rounds depending on the input it would take so that all nodes are located on point in space.

## Inventory System UE5
This more of a sideproject I did during free time. I wanted to learn more about Unreal Engine and decided to implement an RPG like Inventory System.
The UI doesn't look good and mechanics are still very basic, but it works in multiplayer.
Players can pick up items and drop them. They can also equip them in a fitting slot and exchange them with other players by passing them through a chest.
